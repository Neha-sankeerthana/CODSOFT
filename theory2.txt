The code implements a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Python where a human player competes against an AI. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to determine optimal moves.

Code Breakdown
Imports and Constants:

Imports the copy module (not used).
Defines constants for players (PLAYER_X, PLAYER_O) and an empty cell (EMPTY).
Functions:

print_board(board): Displays the current game board.
is_winner(board, player): Checks if the specified player has won.
is_board_full(board): Checks if the board is full.
get_empty_cells(board): Returns a list of empty cell coordinates.
minimax(board, depth, maximizing_player): Implements the Minimax algorithm recursively to evaluate moves and outcomes. It:
Returns the outcome if the game is over.
Maximizes or minimizes the score based on whose turn it is.
Simulates moves and evaluates the results.
find_best_move(board): Uses the Minimax function to find the best move for the AI.
Game Flow:

play_tic_tac_toe(): Controls the main game loop:
Initializes the board and prompts the human for input.
Validates the human's move and updates the board.
Checks for a winner or a full board.
Uses the AIâ€™s move determined by the Minimax algorithm.
Repeats until the game ends.
Running the Game:

The game starts by calling play_tic_tac_toe(), prompting the human for moves until there is a winner or a tie.
Example Game Flow
The board is displayed and the human player enters moves.
The AI responds based on its strategy until either the human or AI wins, or the board is full.
This implementation effectively demonstrates how a human can interact with an AI opponent using established algorithms for decision-making in a classic game.
